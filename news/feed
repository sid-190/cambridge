Anyone who was pregnant at the time of responding or had previously given birth was eligible to take part.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study revealed that autistic parents were around three times more likely than non-autistic parents to report having experienced prenatal depression (9% of non-autistic parents and 24% of autistic parents) and anxiety (14% of non-autistic parents and 48% of autistic parents).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Autistic respondents also experienced lower satisfaction with pregnancy healthcare. Autistic respondents were less likely to trust professionals, feel that professionals took their questions and concerns seriously, feel that professionals treated them respectfully, and be satisfied with how information was presented to them in appointments. Furthermore, autistic respondents were more likely to experience sensory issues during pregnancy and more likely to feel overwhelmed by the sensory environment of prenatal appointments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr Sarah Hampton, lead researcher on the study, said: “This study suggests that autistic people are more vulnerable to mental health difficulties during pregnancy. It is imperative that effective mental health screening and support is available for autistic people during pregnancy.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr Rosie Holt, a member of the research team, added: “The results also suggest that autistic people may benefit from accommodations to prenatal healthcare. These may include adjustments to the sensory environment of healthcare settings, as well as adjustments to how information is communicated during prenatal appointments.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr Carrie Allison, Deputy Director of the Autism Research Centre and a member of the team, said: “We are grateful to members of the autistic community for providing feedback when we designed this research. It is vital that autistic people with lived experience help shape the research we do, and we keep their priorities as a clear focus.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Professor Simon Baron-Cohen, Director of the Autism Research Centre and a member of the research team, said: “It is important that more research is conducted looking at the experiences of autistic new parents, who have been neglected in research. It is also important that this research is translated into health and social care policy and practice to ensure these parents receive the support and adaptations they need in a timely manner.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Previous attempts to make tetrataenite in the laboratory have relied on impractical, extreme methods. But the addition of a common element – phosphorus – could mean that it’s possible to make tetrataenite artificially and at scale, without any specialised treatment or expensive techniques.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The results are reported in the journal &lt;em&gt;Advanced Science&lt;/em&gt;. A patent application on the technology has been filed by Cambridge Enterprise, the University’s commercialisation arm, and the Austrian Academy of Sciences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;High-performance magnets are a vital technology for building a zero-carbon economy, and the best permanent magnets currently available contain rare earth elements. Despite their name, rare earths are plentiful in Earth’s crust. However, China has a near monopoly on global production: in 2017, 81% of rare earths worldwide were sourced from China. Other countries, such as Australia, also mine these elements, but as geopolitical tensions with China increase, there are concerns that rare earth supply could be at risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Rare earth deposits exist elsewhere, but the mining operations are highly disruptive: you have to extract a huge amount of material to get a small volume of rare earths,” said Professor Lindsay Greer from Cambridge’s Department of Materials Science &amp;amp; Metallurgy, who led the research. “Between the environmental impacts, and the heavy reliance on China, there’s been an urgent search for alternative materials that do not require rare earths.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tetrataenite, an iron-nickel alloy with a particular ordered atomic structure, is one of the most promising of those alternatives. Tetrataenite forms over millions of years as a meteorite slowly cools, giving the iron and nickel atoms enough time to order themselves into a particular stacking sequence within the crystalline structure, ultimately resulting in a material with magnetic properties approaching those of rare-earth magnets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the 1960s, scientists were able to artificially form tetrataenite by bombarding iron-nickel alloys with neutrons, enabling the atoms to form the desired ordered stacking, but this technique is not suitable for mass production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Since then, scientists have been fascinated with getting that ordered structure, but it’s always felt like something that was very far away,” said Greer. Despite many attempts over the years, it has not yet been possible to make tetrataenite on anything approaching an industrial scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, Greer and his colleagues from the Austrian Academy of Sciences and the Montanuniversität in Leoben, have found a possible alternative that doesn’t require millions of years of cooling or neutron irradiation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The team was studying the mechanical properties of iron-nickel alloys containing small amounts of phosphorus, an element that is also present in meteorites. The pattern of phases inside these materials showed the expected tree-like growth structure called dendrites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“For most people, it would have ended there: nothing interesting to see in the dendrites, but when I looked closer, I saw an interesting diffraction pattern indicating an ordered atomic structure,” said first author Dr Yurii Ivanov, who completed the work while at Cambridge and is now based at the Italian Institute of Technology in Genoa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At first glance, the diffraction pattern of tetrataenite looks like that of the structure expected for iron-nickel alloys, namely a disordered crystal not of interest as a high-performance magnet. It took Ivanov’s closer look to identify the tetrataenite, but even so, Greer says it’s strange that no one noticed it before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The researchers say that phosphorus, which is present in meteorites, allows the iron and nickel atoms to move faster, enabling them to form the necessary ordered stacking without waiting for millions of years. By mixing iron, nickel and phosphorus in the right quantities, they were able to speed up tetrataenite formation by between 11 and 15 orders of magnitude, such that it forms over a few seconds in simple casting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What was so astonishing was that no special treatment was needed: we just melted the alloy, poured it into a mould, and we had tetrataenite,” said Greer. “The previous view in the field was that you couldn’t get tetrataenite unless you did something extreme, because otherwise, you’d have to wait millions of years for it to form. This result represents a total change in how we think about this material.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the researchers have found a promising method to produce tetrataenite, more work is needed to determine whether it will be suitable for high-performance magnets. The team are hoping to work on this with major magnet manufacturers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The work may also force a revision of views on whether the formation of tetrataenite in meteorites really does take millions of years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research was supported in part by the European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme and Seventh Framework Programme, and the Austrian Science Fund.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Likelihood of receiving an autism diagnosis may depend on where you live</title>

&lt;p&gt;After analysing all new autism cases across England using NHS health service boundaries for possible hotspots, some areas stand out. For example, 45.5% of the NHS Rotherham catchment area had higher-than-average new autism diagnoses clusters. For NHS Heywood, this amounted to 38.8% of its catchment area and 36.9% for NHS Liverpool, pointing at a possible health service effect towards who receives an autism diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research team used four years’ worth of data from the Summer School Census, which collected data from individuals aged 1-18 years old in state-funded schools in England. Of the 32 million pupils studied, more than 102,000 new autism diagnoses were identified between 2014 and 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After adjusting for age and sex, the researchers found that one in 234 children were given a new autism diagnosis during that four-year period. New diagnoses tended to happen when children were transitioning to a new school, whether that was into nursery (1-3 years), primary school (4-6), and secondary school (10-12 years). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Particular communities appeared to have different rates, varying by ethnicity and deprivation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lead researcher Dr Andres Roman-Urrestarazu from the Department of Psychiatry and Cambridge Public Health at the University of Cambridge said: “Autism diagnoses are more common among Black students and other minority ethnic groups. Why this is the case is not clear and so we need to explore the role played by social factors such as ethnicity and area deprivation as well as the nature of local services.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The likelihood of receiving an autism diagnosis more than tripled among girls depending on their ethnicity and social and financial situation compared to white girls without financial disadvantages who speak English as their first language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast, boys’ likelihood of receiving an autism diagnosis increased more than five-fold depending on their ethnicity and social and financial situation compared to white boys without financial disadvantages who speak English as their first language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Boys and young men are already known to be more likely to receive autism diagnoses, but the social determinants that could affect a diagnosis remained an open question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr Robin van Kessel, co-lead researcher from the Department of Health Policy at the London School of Economics and Political Science said: “These new findings show how social determinants interact and can combine to significantly increase the likelihood of an autism diagnosis. As a result, individuals from a minority ethnic background experiencing economic hardship may be significantly more likely to receive an autism diagnosis than their peers.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Professor Carol Brayne from Cambridge Public Health said: “There are clear inequalities in an individual’s likelihood of receiving an autism diagnosis, whether they are socioeconomic factors, ethnicity or even which NHS region or local authority someone lives in.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Artificial intelligence powers record-breaking all-in-one miniature spectrometers </title>

Aalto University.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We see light and colours around us every day. However, to analyse the information it carries, we must analyse light using spectrometers, in the lab. These devices detect sparkles and substances that our eyes would otherwise not notice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, an international team of researchers, including the University of Cambridge, have designed a miniaturised spectrometer that breaks all current resolution records, and does so in a much smaller package, thanks to computational programmes and artificial intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new miniaturised devices could be used in a broad range of sectors, from checking the quality of food to analysing starlight or detecting faint clues of life in outer space. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.add8544&quot;&gt;results&lt;/a&gt; are reported in the journal &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Traditionally, spectrometers rely on bulky components to filter and disperse light. Modern approaches simplify these components to shrink footprints, but still suffer from limited resolution and bandwidth. Additionally, traditional spectrometers are heavy and take up extraordinary amounts of space, which limits their applications in portable and mobile devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To tackle these problems, and shrink the size of the system, researchers have coupled layered materials with artificial intelligence algorithms. The result is an all-in-one spectrometer thousands of times smaller than current commercial systems. At the same time, it offers performance comparable to benchtop systems. In other words, these new spectrometers will provide portable alternatives to uncover otherwise invisible information, without even going into the lab.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We eliminate the need for detector arrays, dispersive components, and filters. It’s an all-in-one, miniaturised device that could revolutionise this field,” said Dr Hoon Hahn Yoon, from Aalto University in Finland, first author of the paper. This spectrometer-on-chip technology is expected to offer high performance and new usability across science and industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The detector uses van der Waals heterostructures – a ‘sandwich’ of different ingredients, including graphene, molybdenum disulfide, and tungsten diselenide. Different combinations of material components enable light detection beyond the visible spectrum, as far as the near-infrared region. This means the spectrometer detects more than just colour, enabling applications such as chemical analysis and night vision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We detect a continuum spectrum of light, opening a world of possibilities in a myriad of markets,” said Yoon. “Exploring other material combinations could uncover further functionalities, including even broader hyperspectral detection and improved resolution.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Artificial intelligence is a key aspect of these devices, commonly called ‘computational’ spectrometers. This technology compensates for the inherent noise increase that inevitably occurs when the optical component is wholly removed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We were able to use mathematical algorithms to successfully reconstruct the signals and spectra, it’s a profound and transformative technological leap,” said lead author Professor Zhipei Sun, also from Aalto University, and a former member of Cambridge’s Department of Engineering. “The current design is just a proof-of-concept. More advanced algorithms, as well as different combinations of materials, could soon provide even better miniaturised spectrometers.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spectrometers are used for toxin detection in food and cosmetics, cancer imaging, and in spacecraft – including the James Webb Space Telescope. And they will soon become more common thanks to the development and advancement of technologies such as the Internet of Things and Industry 4.0.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The detection of light – and the full analysis of spectroscopic information – has applications in sensing, surveillance, smart agriculture, and more. Among the most promising applications for miniaturised spectrometers are chemical and biochemical analysis, thanks to the capabilities of the devices to detect light in the infrared wavelength range.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new devices could be incorporated into instruments like drones, mobile phones, and lab-on-a-chip platforms, which can carry out several experiments in a single integrated circuit. The latter also opens up opportunities in healthcare. In this field, spectrometers and light-detectors are already key components of imaging and diagnostic systems – the new miniaturised devices could enable the simultaneous visualisation and detection of ‘chemical fingerprints’, leading to possibilities in the biomedical area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Our miniaturised spectrometers offer high spatial and spectral resolution at the micrometre and nanometre scales, which is particularly exciting for responsive bio-implants and innovative imaging techniques,” said co-author Professor Tawfique Hasan, from the Cambridge Graphene Centre.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This technology has huge potential for scalability and integration, thanks to its compatibility with well-established industrial processes. It could open up the future for the next generation of smartphone cameras that evolve into hyperspectral cameras that conventional colour cameras cannot do. Researchers hope their contribution is a stepping stone towards the development of more advanced computational spectrometers, with record-breaking accuracy and resolution. This example, they say, is just the first of many.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Clinical trial for new stem cell-based treatment for Parkinson’s disease given go ahead</title>
    <link>https://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/clinical-trial-for-new-stem-cell-based-treatment-for-parkinsons-disease-given-go-ahead</link>
    <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-news-image field-type-image field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;cam-scale-with-grid&quot; src=&quot;https://www.cam.ac.uk/sites/www.cam.ac.uk/files/styles/content-580x288/public/news/research/news/elderly-ga92cd31f4-1920.jpg?itok=L2IZhNUA&quot; alt=&quot;Hands of an elderly man with walking stick&quot; title=&quot;Hands of an elderly man with walking stick, Credit: stevepb&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Swedish Medical Products Agency has granted approval for the trial to proceed; ethical approval has already been obtained from the Swedish Ethics Review Authority. The team, led from Lund University in Sweden, is poised to begin recruitment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;STEM-PD uses human embryonic stem cells, a type of cell that can turn into almost any type of cell in the body. The team has ‘programmed’ the cells to develop into dopamine nerve cell, which will be transplanted into the brains of patients to replace cells that are lost in Parkinson’s disease. The product has already been shown to be safe and effective at reverting motor deficits in animal models of Parkinson’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trial is a collaboration with colleagues at Skåne University Hospital, the University of Cambridge, Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust (CUH), and Imperial College London.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Professor Roger Barker from the Wellcome-MRC Stem Cell Institute at the University of Cambridge and CUH is clinical lead on the project. “The use of stem cells will in theory enable us to make unlimited amounts of dopamine neurons and thus opens the prospect of producing this therapy to a wide patient population. This could transform the way we treat Parkinson’s disease”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the first such trial in Europe and the preclinical and clinical studies of STEM-PD have been funded by national and EU funding agencies. In addition, the STEM-PD team has obtained funding and valuable support for the current study from Novo Nordisk; a collaboration which will continue for future product development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cells to be used in the trial have been manufactured under ‘good manufacturing practice’ at the Royal Free Hospital in London and have undergone rigorous testing in the lab.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Professor Malin Parmar who leads the STEM-PD team from Lund University said: “We are looking forward to this clinical study of STEM-PD, hoping that it could potentially help address the significant burden of Parkinson’s disease. This has been a massive team effort for over a decade, and the regulatory approval is a major and important milestone.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The STEM-PD trial will assess safety and tolerability of the transplanted product one year after transplantation, measuring the effects on Parkinson’s symptoms. The trial will enrol eight patients for transplantation, starting with patients from Sweden, and with subsequent plans for enrolment of patients also from Cambridge University Hospitals. All transplantation surgery will be performed at Skåne University Hospital in Lund.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Parkinson’s disease is the second most common neurodegenerative disease worldwide, yet remains without a cure. Typical motor symptoms of Parkinson’s disease are slowness of movement, tremor and stiffness and later also gait difficulties. It is not well known how the disease arises or develops, but the core feature common to all patients is the loss of dopamine neurons in the midbrain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suitable patients will be invited to participate in the trial; it is not possible to volunteer to participate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Adapted from a press statement from Lund University&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-content-summary field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cambridge researchers will play a key role in clinical trials of a new treatment that involves transplanting healthy nerve cells into the brains of patients with Parkinson’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Cambridge researchers join new £2 million UK consortium to tackle monkeypox outbreak</title>
    <link>https://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/cambridge-researchers-join-new-ps2-million-uk-consortium-to-tackle-monkeypox-outbreak</link>
    <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-news-image field-type-image field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;cam-scale-with-grid&quot; src=&quot;https://www.cam.ac.uk/sites/www.cam.ac.uk/files/styles/content-580x288/public/news/research/news/gettyimages-1400375427-web.jpg?itok=C_--RR-5&quot; alt=&quot;Monkeypox virus - 3D render&quot; title=&quot;Monkeypox virus - 3D render, Credit: 	BlackJack3D&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The consortium has received £2 million from the Biotechnology and Biosciences Research Council and the Medical Research Council, both part of UK Research and Innovation (UKRI). It is led by the Pirbright Institute and the MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Researchers will work closely with experts at government agencies – the Animal and Plant Health Agency, UK Health Security Agency, and Defence Science and Technology Laboratory – to study the current outbreak and inform the public health response in the UK and internationally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cambridge scientists Professor Geoffrey Smith from the Department of Pathology and Professor Mike Weekes from the Cambridge Institute for Medical Research and Department of Medicine are among the key scientists involved in the consortium.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Professor Weekes said: &quot;Monkeypox has become a really important global pathogen, reaching more than 50 countries worldwide in a matter of months. Although we have an effective vaccine and treatment, global roll-out has so far proved challenging, emphasising the importance of a comprehensive understanding of this virus. The UK consortium includes researchers from multiple different disciplines, and I anticipate the data we generate will rapidly help understand how the virus can be targeted in new ways to prevent disease.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Professor Smith said: “Few would have predicted that monkeypox virus would be causing a global epidemic in 2022. The ability to respond quickly to this new challenge has been helped greatly not just by the swift and welcome response of UKRI, but also by decades of support for the study of orthopoxviruses from UKRI and the Wellcome Trust. The information gained from those studies is valuable in the fight against monkeypox virus.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The monkeypox virus outbreak originated in West Africa. The current worldwide outbreak of cases spreading outside this area was first identified in May 2022. This is the first time that many monkeypox cases and clusters have been reported in non-endemic areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the UK there have been more than 3,400 confirmed cases since May, although case numbers are currently falling. Internationally, WHO reports it has spread to 106 countries and territories with 25 confirmed deaths.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Professor Melanie Welham, Executive Chair of BBSRC, said: “One of the real strengths of the UK’s scientific response to disease outbreaks is the way that we can draw on leading researchers from all over the country, who can pool their expertise to deliver results, fast. Long-term support for animal and human virus research has ensured we have the capability to respond with agility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This new national consortium will study the unprecedented monkeypox outbreak to better understand how to tackle it. This will feed rapidly into global public health strategies, developing new diagnostic tests and identifying potential therapies.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The consortium will focus on building our understanding in a number of key areas, including:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Developing new tests and identifying potential control measures:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Developing sensitive point-of-care tests to speed up diagnosis, such as lateral flow tests or LAMP* tests. The lateral flow test development will be conducted with Global Access Diagnostics (GADx) to develop a product which could later be manufactured at scale and used clinically worldwide, including in low/middle income countries.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Screening potential drugs to treat monkeypox in human cells in the lab to determine which ones could be developed for further testing.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Studying the virus, how it infects humans and its susceptibility to the immune response to identify targets for future therapies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studying the virus:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Characterising the genome of the virus and studying how it is evolving, and how this is linked to changes in the transmission and pathology of the virus.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Understanding the human immune response to the virus and the vaccine, including studying samples from infected individuals.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Bryan Charleston, co-lead from The Pirbright Institute, said: “The implications of the current monkeypox outbreak are huge. As well as tackling the current outbreak, we also need to be fully prepared for next outbreak, because worldwide there’s a huge reservoir of infection. One of the key ways we can do this is to develop rapid tests, which are very important to help clinicians on the front line to manage the disease.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Professor Massimo Palmarini, co-lead from the MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research, said: “Monkeypox is public health challenge, so taking decisive, collective action to better understand this virus is paramount. By bringing together research expertise in different areas, we will harness the UK’s world-leading knowledge to learn more about how the virus works and spreads and provide the foundations for the development of potential new treatments.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>UK policing: psychological damage among officers heightened by bad working conditions</title>
    <link>https://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/uk-policing-psychological-damage-among-officers-heightened-by-bad-working-conditions</link>
    <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-news-image field-type-image field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;cam-scale-with-grid&quot; src=&quot;https://www.cam.ac.uk/sites/www.cam.ac.uk/files/styles/content-580x288/public/news/research/news/police-ptsd.jpg?itok=tSIM5x4b&quot; alt=&quot;Police officers in the UK&quot; title=&quot;Credit: None&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;High levels of trauma-related mental health disorders across UK police forces are partly the result of bad working conditions such as having too little time, sexual harassment, and dealing with difficult situations without support, according to a study led by the University of Cambridge. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, officers who say they feel supported by colleagues, and have a sense of doing meaningful work, had around half the rates of a form of &lt;abbr title=&quot;post-traumatic stress disorder&quot;&gt;PTSD&lt;/abbr&gt; as the national average for policing staff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Researchers behind the study say their findings suggest that simple improvements to the working lives of police – scheduled time for support from peers and supervisors, for example – could dramatically reduce the level of psychiatric problems in UK forces. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sociologists surveyed thousands of police personnel across the country in 2018 and found that 12% showed clinical symptoms of Complex Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (C-PTSD), a chronic condition in which repeated trauma exposure causes social disconnection, feelings of worthlessness, and an inability to regulate emotions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Complex PTSD often leads to &#039;burnout&#039; and substance abuse. In fact, 90% of police workers in the original survey study &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cam.ac.uk/policeptsd&quot;&gt;The Job, The Life&lt;/a&gt; had experienced trauma, and one in five of these reported symptoms of either PTSD or C-PTSD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, the same team of researchers have analysed survey data provided by 12,248 serving police officers to determine the working conditions and on-the-job situations with the strongest links to Complex PTSD. &lt;a href=&quot;https://academic.oup.com/policing/advance-article/doi/10.1093/police/paac054/6717934&quot;&gt;The latest findings are published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Policing&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trauma detailed by officers with probable levels of Complex PTSD based on the survey screening included dealing with fatal car accidents, rapes, homicides, suicides – including of children – and drug overdoses.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exposure to physical violence made little difference to rates of C-PTSD, nor did long working hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, officers who described it as “very difficult” to take time away from the job for personal or family matters had C-PTSD rates over 50% higher than the UK-wide average for police.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those who described their relationship between work and personal life as “not fitting well at all”, some 15% of police officers in the study, had twice (24%) the average policing rates of C-PTSD. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One officer suffering with probable C-PTSD described how what you see “impacts on your life outside of work”, offering the example of cases involving dead children that “make you anxious about your own children&#039;s wellbeing. To a degree you lose your innocence.”    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another C-PTSD sufferer said “it is a given and accepted” that the job means exposure to trauma, and describes the occupational health team in their force as “brilliant” but few in number. “They are only able to put &#039;sticky plasters&#039; on, and send the officers back out,” the officer said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Police officers who described never having enough time to “get the job done” had almost double the rates of C-PTSD as the average across UK forces, 22% compared to 12%, as did officers who reported experiencing sexual harassment – whether from the public or colleagues.    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Officers who said they could never rely on the help and support of colleagues were most likely to suffer with Complex PTSD, with over 43% displaying symptoms, but such claims were relatively rare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One detective with C-PTSD symptoms recounted dealing with sexual abuse cases as the sole investigating officer. “Little or no support from management. Victims hanging all their hopes and pressures on me.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By contrast, C-PTSD rates were just 7% among those who said they could always rely on colleagues, and just 6% among those who say they regularly get a feeling of a job well done, with researchers claiming that a sense of meaningful work may provide a &#039;protective effect&#039; mentally.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Our research shows that the debilitating psychological misery often caused by trauma exposure isn’t an inevitable part of the difficult job of policing, it is exacerbated by poor working conditions,” said Prof Brendan Burchell, lead author from Cambridge’s Department of Sociology.    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The team also conducted analyses beyond individual officers to compare forces, revealing a strong link between “wor&#039; intensity&#039; – those forces with more officers reporting a lack of time to effectively police – and increased rates of Complex PTSD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of 18 anonymised UK police forces, the one with the highest reported time constraints among officers had C-PTSD rates of 29%, well over double the average for the overall policing population.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Severe austerity cuts since 2010 leading to a marked reduction in police numbers without a decrease in the demands of the job inevitably creates more time pressure for remaining officers,” said Burchell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Single-crewing, shift work and fewer resources mean that time for encouraging words between colleagues or space for officers to acknowledge their traumatic experiences are few and far between.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One officer with probable C-PTSD described being “single crewed” at a rural location for a year, with nearest support almost an hour away. Another spoke of going from a shift team of five to working alone. “My coping strategy of being around colleagues who had been to the same fatal accident or suicide was taken away from me.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cambridge co-author Dr Jessica Miller, who is also director of research for Police Care UK, the charity that funded the research, added: “The police forces reporting the best working conditions had much lower rates of PTSD. Modest investments to improve their working conditions could see significant reductions in psychological problems among police officers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-content-summary field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nationwide study of over 12,000 officers suggests rates of trauma-induced disorder Complex PTSD are exacerbated by factors such as too little time and support, and lack of say over working hours.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Offshore carbon storage deployment and research needs to scale up for UK to deliver net zero pledge, says report </title>

&lt;p&gt;Alongside sustained reductions in carbon emissions, international bodies and the UK’s Committee on Climate Change identified carbon capture and storage (CCS) as a critical technology in most possible routes to achieving net zero.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the levels of CCS deployment globally have been slow and, globally, are ‘well below those anticipated to be needed to limit global warming to 1.5°C, or 2°C’, the report warns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Geological carbon storage will be an essential part of our long-term energy transition, both in storing emissions from hard-to-decarbonise industries, and for longer-term removal of CO2 through direct air capture,” said Professor Andy Woods from Cambridge’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ieef.cam.ac.uk&quot;&gt;Institute for Energy and Environmental Flows (IEEF)&lt;/a&gt;, chair of the report’s working group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The UK’s access to potential storage sites in its offshore waters, along with a strong industrial base and regulatory and assurance environment, mean this could be an important industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“But thousands of wells are likely to be needed globally, and each new subsurface reservoir can take years to develop to ensure its suitability.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scaling up&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The policy briefing considers the latest geoscience evidence and lessons from current and planned CCS projects that could inform policymakers if they pursue geological carbon storage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also looks at the challenges of scaling up CCS, including outstanding research and policy questions relating to transport, storage, monitoring, sustainable business models and incentives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The IPCC special report on global warming of 1.5°C and research by the International Energy Agency suggest that 7-8 gigatonnes of CO2 will need to be stored globally each year by 2050 to keep warming below 1.5°C: this represents over 20% of present global annual fossil fuel and industrial emissions (roughly 34 gigatonnes of CO2 per year).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By 2100, cumulative storage of between 350-1200 gigatonnes of CO2 is likely to be needed to avoid the worst effects of climate change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the UK to deliver on its net zero carbon emissions pledge, it needs to develop new wells – and the associated injection, transport and storage infrastructure – capable of storing about 75-175 megatonnes of CO2 every year by 2050, according to the UK North Sea Transition Authority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With CO2 injection rates currently constrained by pressurisation limits, and a 5-7 year timeframe to deploy a new reservoir, the report’s expert working group estimates this will require the equivalent of around one new carbon storage system, capable of injecting 4-5 megatonnes of CO2 per year, being added each year to 2050.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sustained investment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To date, the upfront capital costs, lack of sufficient and predictable incentives to support operating costs, and concerns over the social acceptability in many jurisdictions have contributed to a global under-deployment of CCS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Global CCS Institute’s 2021 survey lists 27 CCS projects as being operational, capturing 36.6 megatonnes of CO2 per year, with a further 62 projects listed as either in construction or advanced development. If successfully deployed, the combined capture potential would be 86.4 megatonnes of CO2 per year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A UK target of delivering CCS in four industrial clusters, set under the previous government, aims to capture and store around 20-30 megatonnes of CO2 each year. With Phase 1 sites, in the East Coast Cluster (Teesside plus Humber) and HyNet in the Northwest, targeting delivery in the middle of this decade. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scaling up required capacity, the report says, demands an enormous and continued global investment each year to 2050 to build the injection wells, transport networks, monitoring technologies, and a skilled workforce, to install hundreds of new wells each year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We have technology to store and monitor carbon in this way,” said Woods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“But as deployment of these technologies rolls out, there will likely be many new challenges, especially since each storage reservoir has its own unique geological structure and setting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“So we need to continue to invest in research, and the policy and regulatory frameworks that are required to scale up safely and at pace.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In particular, the report highlights the need to understand the storage capacity and properties of different geological formations; the critical pressures which might cause seal rocks to fail and leak; different monitoring strategies for detecting CO2 leaks, new understanding of some of the geochemical processes; and the potential to increase capacity in old wells.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is also a need to for ongoing effective public dialogue to highlight the importance of carbon storage in mitigating climate change, and to understand and address the concerns of communities and citizens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It had been assumed that the mechanism by which lithium ions are stored in battery materials is uniform across the individual active particles. However, the Cambridge-led team found that during the charge-discharge cycle, lithium storage is anything but uniform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the battery is near the end of its discharge cycle, the surfaces of the active particles become saturated by lithium while their cores are lithium deficient. This results in the loss of reusable lithium and a reduced capacity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research, funded by the Faraday Institution, could help improve existing battery materials and could accelerate the development of next-generation batteries. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2542435122004743&quot;&gt;results&lt;/a&gt; are published in &lt;em&gt;Joule&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Electrical vehicles (EVs) are vital in the transition to a zero-carbon economy. Most electric vehicles on the road today are powered by lithium-ion batteries, due in part to their high energy density.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, as EV use becomes more widespread, the push for longer ranges and faster charging times means that current battery materials need to be improved, and new materials need to be identified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the most promising of these materials are state-of-the-art positive electrode materials known as layered lithium nickel-rich oxides, which are widely used in premium EVs. However, their working mechanisms, particularly lithium-ion transport under practical operating conditions, and how this is linked to their electrochemical performance, are not fully understood, so we cannot yet obtain maximum performance from these materials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By tracking how light interacts with active particles during battery operation under a microscope, the researchers observed distinct differences in lithium storage during the charge-discharge cycle in nickel-rich manganese cobalt oxide (NMC).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This is the first time that this non-uniformity in lithium storage has been directly observed in individual particles,” said co-first author Alice Merryweather, from Cambridge’s Yusuf Hamied Department of Chemistry. “Real time techniques like ours are essential to capture this while the battery is cycling.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Combining the experimental observations with computer modelling, the researchers found that the non-uniformity originates from drastic changes to the rate of lithium-ion diffusion in NMC during the charge-discharge cycle. Specifically, lithium ions diffuse slowly in fully lithiated NMC particles, but the diffusion is significantly enhanced once some lithium ions are extracted from these particles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Our model provides insights into the range over which lithium-ion diffusion in NMC varies during the early stages of charging,” said co-first author Dr Shrinidhi Pandurangi from Cambridge’s Department of Engineering. “Our model predicted lithium distributions accurately and captured the degree of heterogeneity observed in experiments. These predictions are key to understanding other battery degradation mechanisms such as particle fracture.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Importantly, the lithium heterogeneity seen at the end of discharge establishes one reason why nickel-rich cathode materials typically lose around ten percent of their capacity after the first charge-discharge cycle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This is significant, considering one industrial standard that is used to determine whether a battery should be retired or not is when it has lost 20 percent of its capacity,” said co-first author Dr Chao Xu, from ShanghaiTech University, who completed the research while based at Cambridge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The researchers are now seeking new approaches to increase the practical energy density and lifetime of these promising battery materials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research was supported in part by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC), part of UK Research and Innovation (UKRI). Alice Merryweather is jointly supervised by Professor Dame Clare Grey and Dr Akshay Rao, who are both co-authors on the current paper.  &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Scientists detect dementia signs as early as nine years ahead of diagnosis</title>
    <link>https://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/scientists-detect-dementia-signs-as-early-as-nine-years-ahead-of-diagnosis</link>

&lt;p&gt;The findings raise the possibility that in the future, at-risk patients could be screened to help select those who would benefit from interventions to reduce their risk of developing one of the conditions, or to help identify patients suitable for recruitment to clinical trials for new treatments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are currently very few effective treatments for dementia or other neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson’s disease. In part, this is because these conditions are often only diagnosed once symptoms appear, whereas the underlying neurodegeneration may have begun years – even decades – earlier. This means that by the time patients take part in clinical trials, it may already be too late in the disease process to alter its course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until now, it has been unclear whether it might be possible to detect changes in brain function before the onset of symptoms. To help answer this question, researchers at the University of Cambridge and Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust turned to UK Biobank, a biomedical database and research resource containing anonymised genetic, lifestyle and health information from half a million UK participants aged 40-69.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As well as collecting information on participants’ health and disease diagnoses, UK Biobank collected data from a battery of tests including problem solving, memory, reaction times and grip strength, as well as data on weight loss and gain and on the number of falls. This allowed them to look back to see whether any signs were present at baseline – that is, when measurements were first collected from participants (between five and nine years prior to diagnosis).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People who went on to develop Alzheimer’s disease scored more poorly compared to healthy individuals when it came to problem solving tasks, reaction times, remembering lists of numbers, prospective memory (our ability to remember to do something later on) and pair matching. This was also the case for people who developed a rarer form of dementia known as frontotemporal dementia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People who went on to develop Alzheimer’s were more likely than healthy adults to have had a fall in the previous 12 months. Those patients who went on to develop a rare neurological condition known as progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), which affects balance, were more than twice as likely as healthy individuals to have had a fall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For every condition studied – including Parkinson’s disease and dementia with Lewy bodies – patients reported poorer overall health at baseline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First author Nol Swaddiwudhipong, a junior doctor at the University of Cambridge, said: “When we looked back at patients’ histories, it became clear that they were showing some cognitive impairment several years before their symptoms became obvious enough to prompt a diagnosis. The impairments were often subtle, but across a number of aspects of cognition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This is a step towards us being able to screen people who are at greatest risk – for example, people over 50 or those who have high blood pressure or do not do enough exercise – and intervene at an earlier stage to help them reduce their risk.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Senior author Dr Tim Rittman from the Department of Clinical Neurosciences at the University of Cambridge added: “People should not be unduly worried if, for example, they are not good at recalling numbers. Even some healthy individuals will naturally score better or worse than their peers. But we would encourage anyone who has any concerns or notices that their memory or recall is getting worse to speak to their GP.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr Rittman said the findings could also help identify people who can participate in clinical trials for potential new treatments. “The problem with clinical trials is that by necessity they often recruit patients with a diagnosis, but we know that by this point they are already some way down the road and their condition cannot be stopped. If we can find these individuals early enough, we’ll have a better chance of seeing if the drugs are effective.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research was funded by the Medical Research Council with support from the NIHR Cambridge Biomedical Research Centre.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new contract will provide a ‘split service’, with half of Universal buses serving Girton College at the northern end of the route, and half routed along Grange Road and Newnham Road to better serve Wolfson College, with some returning to Hills Road to connect with Homerton College and the Faculty of Education.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Route U, the University bus for everyone, is subsidised by the University of Cambridge, and carries around 60,000 people per week, linking Eddington with West Cambridge, the city centre, the train station and the Cambridge Biomedical Campus. University staff and students use the service, as well as Eddington residents, sixth-form students, shoppers, tourists and key workers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The University’s Planning and Resources Committee approved the introduction of the electric service, replacing the existing diesel service, and the route extension. The £1 fare for University Card holders will be retained despite the significant additional investment from the University in the new bus service. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Professor David Cardwell, Pro-Vice-Chancellor for Strategy and Planning, said: “We are delighted to announce that the Universal bus service will operate with a fleet of new electric buses from next year, and that students, staff and members of the public will soon be able to also use the service at Girton College, Homerton College and Wolfson College. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Colleagues, in particular the University’s Sustainability Team, have worked hard on what are significant enhancements to the existing service, and have welcomed the positive working relationship they have had with student representatives, and their perspective on the service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The Universal bus is a pioneering initiative, and this new contract will support the University’s commitment to environmental sustainability, in particular sustainable business travel, as well as its work to meet the access requirements of all students.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Assessments of thinking skills may misrepresent poor, inner-city children in the US</title>
    <link>https://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/assessments-of-thinking-skills-may-misrepresent-poor-inner-city-children-in-the-us</link>

The study links this to probable cultural bias in the assessment design and suggests that this may be replicated in other, similar tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any such design flaw may have influenced a growing body of research which suggests that children from poorer backgrounds tend to start school with less well-developed executive functions.  ‘Executive functions’ is a collective term for a set of essential thinking skills needed to carry out everyday tasks, and learning. They include working memory, self-control, the ability to ignore distractions and easily switch between tasks. Children with good executive functions tend to have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0022096511000191?via%3Dihub&quot;&gt;better test scores&lt;/a&gt;, better &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev-psych-113011-143750&quot;&gt;mental health&lt;/a&gt; and greater &lt;a href=&quot;https://nyaspubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1196/annals.1412.011&quot;&gt;employment potential&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One common method for measuring the healthy development of these skills involves asking teachers to complete questionnaires about children’s observed behaviours. The results can potentially help pinpoint children – or entire groups – who need extra support. They also provide a rich source of data for research on how executive functions develop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the new study, researchers found that one of these teacher rating scales, which has been widely used in the United States, was of limited value when assessing poorer, urban students. Specifically, they found that the executive function screener of a version of the Behaviour Assessment System for Children (BASC), called the BASC-2, “is not a good representation of everyday executive function behaviours by children from schools in high-poverty communities”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The team, from the University of Cambridge (UK) and Virginia Commonweath University (US) suggest that the likely cause is that both this scale, and others like it, have been developed using an unrepresentative sample of children.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Researchers have &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary-wiley-com.ezp.lib.cam.ac.uk/doi/10.1002/icd.2286&quot;&gt;previously pointed out&lt;/a&gt; that these assessments tend to be modelled on children who are mostly from comfortable socio-economic settings. By mapping their observed behaviours on to executive functions, they may falsely assume that these behaviours are ‘normal’ markers for any child of the same age. In reality, children’s different backgrounds and lived experiences may mean that executive functions express themselves differently across different groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Annie Zonneveld, from the Faculty of Education, University of Cambridge and the study’s first author, said: “There is a big question around how we measure executive functions: are we actually using the right tools? If they are based on white, middle-class students, we cannot be sure that they would actually work for the whole population. We may be seeing evidence of that here.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Michelle Ellefson, Professor of Cognitive Science at the Faculty of Education, said: “Teachers can provide us with really valuable data about children’s executive functions because they can monitor development in ways we could not possibly replicate in a lab, but they need effective measures to do this. This means the assessments must draw on information about children from different backgrounds.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.childrensdefense.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/The-State-of-Americas-Children-2021.pdf&quot;&gt;Children’s Defense Fund&lt;/a&gt;, about 14% of children in the United States live in poverty. While nearly 50% of all children are from ethnic minority families, 71% of those in poverty are from these backgrounds. Most psychometric research on executive functions, however, focuses on white, middle-income, or affluent families. It has never been clear how far its findings can be generalised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new study examined the executive function components of two versions of the BASC: the BASC-2 and BASC-3. These ask teachers to observe children’s everyday behaviours and rate, on a scale of ‘never’ to ‘always’, how far they agree with statements such as “acts without thinking”, “is easily distracted”, “cannot wait to take turn”, “is a self-starter” and “argues when denied own way”. They then extrapolate information about the children’s executive functions based on the responses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The researchers analysed two sample groups of children, aged around nine or 10, all from state schools in high-poverty, urban areas in the United States. In total, 472 children took part. The first sample was assessed using the BASC-2; the other using the BASC-3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both groups also completed six computer-based tasks which psychologists and neuroscientists use in lab-based tasks to measure specific executive functions. The researchers looked at how far the scores from these computerised tasks – which are accurate but difficult to run with large groups – corresponded to the measures from the teacher-administered surveys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The findings indicated that while the BASC-2 provides a reasonable overview of students’ general executive functioning, it does not capture accurate details about specific functions like working memory and self-control. The BASC-3 was far more effective, probably because it uses a different and more focused set of questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The BASC-2 has been used extensively in archived datasets and contributes to academic research about how executive functions develop,” Ellefson said. “It is really important to recognise that without modification, it is not an appropriate basis for making judgements about certain groups of children.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The assessment is just one of many surveys that measure children’s cognitive development in different countries. “It is important that we know how these tools are establishing their baseline understanding of ‘typical’ development,” Zonneveld said. “If they are based on mostly white populations from affluent suburbs, they won’t necessarily be as representative as we might hope.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study is published in Developmental Science.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Cambridge students first to receive new Ukraine STEM fund scholarships</title>
    <link>https://www.cam.ac.uk/news/cambridge-students-first-to-receive-new-ukraine-stem-fund-scholarships</link>
    <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-news-image field-type-image field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;cam-scale-with-grid&quot; src=&quot;https://www.cam.ac.uk/sites/www.cam.ac.uk/files/styles/content-580x288/public/news/news/griffin-580x288.jpg?itok=vnpwT4_m&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;Credit: None&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Ukraine Math and Science Achievement Fund launched this academic year with a $3 million donation from Ken Griffin, founder and CEO of U.S.-based global financial firm Citadel. The new multi-year scholarship program has been established to help exceptional Ukrainian students continue their science, technology, engineering, and maths (STEM) studies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Ukrainian students – including some of the brightest of their generation – have faced unimaginable hardship and have had their education and futures disrupted,” Ken Griffin said. “The Ukraine Math and Science Achievement Fund aims to ensure that these brilliant students have the opportunity to realise their academic ambitions and leave their mark on the world.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fund will provide tuition assistance and other support to help dozens of top Ukrainian students affected by the war pursue STEM studies at leading educational institutions around the world and will be administered by the Digital Harbor Foundation in Baltimore, Maryland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three of the initial Griffin Scholars hail from Lyceum 27 in Kharkiv, a city in Ukraine that has been particularly hard hit by the war. They include Ihor Pylaiev, an International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) two-time gold medalist who, with a perfect score, was this year’s overall IMO winner; IMO two-time silver medalist Svyatoslav Deniskov; and IMO bronze medalist Vadym Hasseiev. Four additional Griffin Scholars – Liza Horokh, Roksolana Ivanchuk, Mariia Mikhnovska, and Anton Havrilyuk – studied in Ukraine&#039;s capital city of Kyiv. Like their Kharkiv peers, they have each medaled at various Olympiads, share a passion for maths and problem-solving, and have endured war-related hardships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fund has enabled four of these outstanding students to accept offers to study at the University of Cambridge this autumn; the three other members of the first cohort are attending Hills Road Sixth Form College in the City of Cambridge. Future funding rounds beginning later this year will allow additional talented Ukrainian students to pursue educational opportunities around the world and scholarships to study at universities in Europe and the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ukraine Math and Science Achievement Fund builds on an effort led by Dr. Ferenc Huszár, an associate professor of computer science at Cambridge; Dr. Iryna Korshunova, a machine learning researcher; and a group of volunteers who have been providing the displaced Olympiad community from Ukraine with access to financial support, laptops, and educational resources since the start of the war. After learning about this grassroots effort, Ken Griffin was inspired to amplify this work and further support top STEM students seeking to pursue their studies and maximise their potential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The talent and determination these students have shown in recent months is inspiring,” said Dr. Huszár. “Despite the stress and uncertainty they have faced, they went on to solve complex problems, to learn, and to compete with incredible success. This fund not only enables them to study at top schools, but also recognises the hard work and talent of these students and their teachers.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to this new scholarship fund, Griffin’s firms, Citadel and Citadel Securities, also sponsored Ukraine’s Informatics Olympiad team earlier this year, when the war jeopardised the team’s ability to compete internationally. The funding enabled a group of students to train in Poland, compete in Olympiad competitions across Europe, and travel to Indonesia in August to compete in the International Olympiad in Informatics, the most prestigious computer science competition for secondary and high school students around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ukrainian team placed first among all the European teams and sixth globally at the competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;The Olympiad has changed their lives,” said Anton Tsypko, the coach of the Ukrainian Olympiad team. “In the midst of an incredibly challenging period, it has opened new doors for these talented students and put them on a path to pursue their studies at top universities. I look forward to the contributions they’ll make within their academic communities and society more broadly.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Members of the Olympiad team are among the students eligible to apply for scholarships from the Ukraine Math and Science Achievement Fund as they look to continue their studies at the world’s top universities upon graduation. Applications for funding this year and next will be accepted on a rolling basis beginning later this autumn at ukraineachievementfund.org. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-content-summary field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Four Cambridge undergraduates will become the first university scholars to receive support from a new global education fund created for talented Ukrainian maths and science students whose education has been affected by Russia’s invasion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-content-quote field-type-text-long field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;Ukrainian students – including some of the brightest of their generation – have faced unimaginable hardship and have had their education and futures disrupted&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-content-quote-name field-type-text field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;Ken Griffin&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-cc-attribute-text field-type-text-long field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/&quot; rel=&quot;license&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Creative Commons License&quot; src=&quot;https://i.creativecommons.org/l/by/4.0/88x31.png&quot; style=&quot;border-width:0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

    <title>Claims AI can boost workplace diversity are ‘spurious and dangerous’, researchers argue</title>
    <link>https://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/claims-ai-can-boost-workplace-diversity-are-spurious-and-dangerous-researchers-argue</link>
    <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-news-image field-type-image field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;cam-scale-with-grid&quot; src=&quot;https://www.cam.ac.uk/sites/www.cam.ac.uk/files/styles/content-580x288/public/news/research/news/drage-ai-pic.jpg?itok=Zyhxqn8w&quot; alt=&quot;Co-author Dr Eleanor Drage testing the &amp;#039;personality machine&amp;#039; built by Cambridge undergraduates.&quot; title=&quot;Co-author Dr Eleanor Drage testing the &amp;amp;#039;personality machine&amp;amp;#039; built by Cambridge undergraduates., Credit: Eleanor Drage&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recent years have seen the emergence of AI tools marketed as an answer to lack of diversity in the workforce, from use of chatbots and CV scrapers to line up prospective candidates, through to analysis software for video interviews. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those behind the technology claim it cancels out human biases against gender and ethnicity during recruitment, instead using algorithms that read vocabulary, speech patterns and even facial micro-expressions to assess huge pools of job applicants for the right personality type and &#039;culture fit&#039;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, in a new report &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13347-022-00543-1&quot;&gt;published in &lt;em&gt;Philosophy and Technology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, researchers from Cambridge’s Centre for Gender Studies argue these claims make some uses of AI in hiring little better than an &#039;automated pseudoscience&#039; reminiscent of physiognomy or phrenology: the discredited beliefs that personality can be deduced from facial features or skull shape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They say it is a dangerous example of &#039;technosolutionism&#039;: turning to technology to provide quick fixes for deep-rooted discrimination issues that require investment and changes to company culture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, the researchers have worked with a team of Cambridge computer science undergraduates to debunk these new hiring techniques by building &lt;a href=&quot;https://personal-ambiguator-frontend.vercel.app/&quot;&gt;an AI tool modelled on the technology&lt;/a&gt;, available online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ‘Personality Machine’ demonstrates how arbitrary changes in facial expression, clothing, lighting and background can give radically different personality readings – and so could make the difference between rejection and progression for a generation of job seekers vying for graduate positions.            &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Cambridge team say that use of AI to narrow candidate pools may ultimately increase uniformity rather than diversity in the workforce, as the technology is calibrated to search for the employer’s fantasy &#039;ideal candidate&#039;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This could see those with the right training and background &quot;win over the algorithms&quot; by replicating behaviours the AI is programmed to identify, and taking those attitudes into the workplace, say the researchers.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, as algorithms are honed using past data, they argue that candidates considered the best fit are likely to end up those that most closely resembling the current workforce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We are concerned that some vendors are wrapping ‘snake oil’ products in a shiny package and selling them to unsuspecting customers,” said co-author Dr Eleanor Drage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“By claiming that racism, sexism and other forms of discrimination can be stripped away from the hiring process using artificial intelligence, these companies reduce race and gender down to insignificant data points, rather than systems of power that shape how we move through the world.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The researchers point out that these AI recruitment tools are often proprietary – or &#039;black box&#039; – so how they work is a mystery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“While companies may not be acting in bad faith, there is little accountability for how these products are built or tested,” said Drage. “As such, this technology, and the way it is marketed, could end up as dangerous sources of misinformation about how recruitment can be ‘de-biased’ and made fairer.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite some pushback – the EU’s proposed AI Act classifies AI-powered hiring software as &#039;high risk&#039;, for example – researchers say that tools made by companies such as Retorio and myInterview are deployed with little regulation, and point to surveys suggesting use of AI in hiring is snowballing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A 2020 study of 500 organisations across various industries in five countries found 24% of businesses have implemented AI for recruitment purposes and 56% of hiring managers planned to adopt it in the next year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another poll of 334 leaders in human resources, conducted in April 2020, as the pandemic took hold, found that 86% of organisations were incorporating new virtual technology into hiring practices.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This trend was in already in place as the pandemic began, and the accelerated shift to online working caused by COVID-19 is likely to see greater deployment of AI tools by HR departments in future,” said co-author Dr Kerry Mackereth, who presents &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gender.cam.ac.uk/technology-gender-and-intersectionality-research-project/the-good-robot-podcast&quot;&gt;the Good Robot podcast&lt;/a&gt; with Drage, in which the duo explore the ethics of technology. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;COVID-19 is not the only factor, according to HR operatives the researchers have interviewed. “Volume recruitment is increasingly untenable for human resources teams that are desperate for software to cut costs as well as numbers of applicants needing personal attention,” said Mackereth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drage and Mackereth say many companies now use AI to analyse videos of candidates, interpreting personality by assessing regions of a face – similar to lie-detection AI – and scoring for the &#039;big five&#039; personality tropes: extroversion, agreeableness, openness, conscientiousness, and neuroticism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The undergraduates behind the ‘Personality Machine’, which uses a similar technique to expose its flaws, say that while their tool may not help users beat the algorithm, it will give job seekers a flavour of the kinds of AI scrutiny they might be under – perhaps even without their knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“All too often, the hiring process is oblique and confusing,” said Euan Ong, one of the student developers. “We want to give people a visceral demonstration of the sorts of judgements that are now being made about them automatically&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“These tools are trained to predict personality based on common patterns in images of people they’ve previously seen, and often end up finding spurious correlations between personality and apparently unrelated properties of the image, like brightness. We made a toy version of the sorts of models we believe are used in practice, in order to experiment with it ourselves,” Ong said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-content-summary field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research highlights growing market in AI-powered recruitment tools that claim to bypass human bias to remove discrimination from hiring. &lt;/p&gt;

There have been particular concerns about marginalised groups such as the very poorest children and girls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new study, which used enrolment data from 358 Rwandan secondary schools, collected both before and after the closures, found that rather than undergoing a sharp fall, student numbers actually rose when schools reopened. The cause appears to have been a combination of existing students returning, and the enrolment of other pupils who were out of school before the pandemic began.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Researchers say that this may represent an emerging trend, because as-yet unpublished results from other sub-Saharan countries, such as Ethiopia and Malawi, similarly show no steep fall in numbers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite this, a more gradual, long-term decline in the numbers of children in school may be underway. The research tracked enrolment past the point where schools reopened in Rwanda, and up to May 2021. By that stage, some students did appear to be dropping out of the system. This was particularly true of those from marginalised groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research was undertaken by a team from the University of Cambridge and the East African research and data collection firm, Laterite, and was carried out for the Mastercard Foundation’s Leaders in Teaching Initiative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Professor Pauline Rose, Director of the Research for Equitable Access and Learning (REAL) Centre, at the Faculty of Education, University of Cambridge, said: “Given the seriousness of the impact of COVID-19, I wouldn’t have been surprised if enrolment rates had halved when schools reopened. We are still developing a comprehensive picture of the situation across Sub-Saharan Africa, but the impact on drop-outs appears far less extreme than initially feared.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It is important we continue to monitor the situation. There was clearly real enthusiasm for schools to reopen at first, but there are now signs that some children may potentially be disappearing from the system.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Schools in Rwanda closed in March 2020 and did not reopen until November, when they did so on a staggered basis. The research collected aggregate enrolment data from before the pandemic, in February 2020, and a year later, in February 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This showed that after schools reopened, enrolment rates rose in the Secondary 1 and Secondary 4 year groups: natural entry points into the Rwandan system because they mark the start of lower and upper secondary school respectively. Enrolment rose by 7% at the Secondary 1 level, and 11% at Secondary 4, in February 2021. Numbers remained steady in the other year groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crucially, the Rwanda Basic Education Board decided to make all students return to the year group that they were previously in when schools reopened. This means that the Secondary 1 and 4 year groups comprised the same cohorts across 2020 and 2021. The rise in numbers was therefore almost certainly due to students who had previously dropped out re-joining their cohort in February 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study also gathered both enrolment and assessment data from a sample of 2,800 students in the Secondary 3 year group, which it followed up to May 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By that stage, researchers found, some students had started to drop out. About 89% of the entire sample group were still in school by May 2021, but the figure was lower among girls, and particularly among students who were over the ‘expected’ cohort age because they had been kept back an additional year or more. The overage group were also disproportionately likely to come from less-wealthy backgrounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Keeping track of these children is really important,” Mico Rudasingwa, Research Associate at Laterite said. “By the time they reach adolescence, those from the poorest backgrounds in particular are in danger of dropping out early to support with income generating activities for the household.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sample group of students also took a learning assessment, in the form of a numeracy test, in February 2020, and again in May 2021 – two terms after their return to school. The results were measured using a ‘latent ability score’ – given as a figure between 0 and 1 – which takes into account not only how many questions they got right, but how difficult those questions were. The average score rose from 0.47 in the first test to 0.52 in the second. Over 90% of the schools in the sample group recorded an average improvement in numeracy scores.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although positive, these results should be treated with caution, as there is no counterfactual evidence available about how much their test results might have improved had the school closures never occurred. The learning levels of some groups also improved more than others. Boys generally outperformed girls by about 0.02 points on the latent ability scale, while overage students again lagged behind their peers, by about 0.03 points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study also collected teacher retention data by tracking 1,700 teachers in science, technology, engineering and maths (STEM) subjects before and after the closures. Around 94% of STEM teachers returned to their classes in early 2021, and almost half the schools surveyed saw an overall increase in STEM teachers through new recruitment. The report describes this low turnover rate as ‘encouraging’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The full report is available on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.educ.cam.ac.uk/centres/real/publications/&quot;&gt;REAL Centre website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
